# BMW X5 2018 (G05)

_Created with [Ramses Composer Version 0.13.1](https://github.com/bmwcarit/ramses-composer)_

#
# How to open the project?

## Download the Ramses Composer

Direct links:

* [Windows](https://github.com/bmwcarit/ramses-composer/releases/download/v0.13.1/RamsesComposerWindows_v0.13.1.zip)
* [Linux](https://github.com/bmwcarit/ramses-composer/releases/download/v0.13.1/RamsesComposerLinux_v0.13.1.zip)

## Start the Ramses Composer

Go to bin/RelWithDebInfo, start RamsesComposer.exe on Windows, RamsesComposer.sh on Linux.

## Open the car project

Open the [G05 project file (G05_main.rca)](./G05_main.rca) via File->Open.

#
# Change settings and experiment

#
## Open the control script

Uncollapse the `root` node in the `Scene Graph` tab and select the `SceneControls` script:

![Interface](./docs/interface.png)

In the `Property Browser` tab you will see a list of inputs you can set/modify:

![Properties](./docs/properties.png)

#
## Modify some of the car features

### Changing Car Paint

* To change the car paint, use the numeric _CarPaint_ID_ property
* There are 7 different paints with different surface attributes and colors which can be applied to the model

### Changing Camera Perspective

* To change the camera perspective, use the numeric _CameraPerspective_ID_ property
* There are 6 different, pre-defined camera perspectives for viewing the car

### Opening / Closing the Doors

* All doors can be opened or closed individually
* To set the door opening angles, use these properties:
  * *Door_F_L_OpeningValue* (front left)
  * *Door_F_R_OpeningValue* (front right)
  * *Door_B_L_OpeningValue* (rear left)
  * *Door_B_R_OpeningValue* (rear right)
* The door, for values of its respective property, is closed at 0.0 and fully open at 1.0.
For values in between 0 and 1, the door angle is interpolated proportionally to the value (e.g. 0.5 is half-open)

### Opening / Closing the Tailgate

* To set the tailgate opening angle, use the _Tailgate_OpeningValue_ property
* Analogous to the doors, the tailgate can also be opened or closed
* The tailgate is closed at 0.0 and fully open at 1.0.
For values in between 0 and 1, the tailgate angle is interpolated proportionally to the value (e.g. 0.5 is half-open) 

You can find more detailed documentation of the input values by looking into the [actual control script (SceneControls.lua)](./scripts/SceneControls.lua)
which you can open from the pencil button right next to the `URI` field in the Property Browser.

#
## What to do next

To learn how to modify the scene in more complex ways, or simply understand how it works,
please refer to the [Ramses Composer tutorials](https://github.com/bmwcarit/ramses-composer-docs) which explain the various features of the
Composer with interactive examples.

#
## Rendering Tip

By default, the _Ramses Preview_ window in Ramses Composer shows you the unvarnished truth about every pixel. In order to get an impression of what the car would look like in a target environment with antialiasing enabled, switch the drop down box above the render view from _Nearest filtering_ to _Linear filtering_

#
## Dependencies

This project uses external references extensively (see [the official documentation on external references](https://github.com/bmwcarit/ramses-composer-docs/tree/master/advanced/external_references)).  
It contains external references to the following reusable projects (make sure they remain in the same relative paths):
* [CameraCrane](_shared/CameraCrane)
* [Environment](_shared/Environment)
* [MatLib](_shared/MatLib)

#
## Disclaimer

The G05 OSS is based on a PoC project. Thus, it was created with limited time, resources, and manpower. We know that the project is not perfect and would likely look differently after a few rounds of optimization.

However, we still believe that the G05 is a worthwhile demo for the capabilities of the Ramses Composer, as it displays a great deal of features of the software.
It has quite realistic graphics and a complex setup which is modeled after industry-related use-cases.

Over time, we want to maintain and improve the demo and enrich it with new and upcoming features of Ramses, so stay tuned for that.
