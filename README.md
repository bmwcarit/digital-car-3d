# Digital 3D assets of BMW vehicles

A repository to hold a digital 3D version of previously released BMW vehicles.

<!-- TODO Update link to ramses3d.org as soon as it's ready -->
This project is meant to allow experimentation with the [Ramses 3D rendering
and infotainment toolchain](https://ramses-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

# Vehicle models

Currently only a single model is released - a BMW X5 released back in 2018.
Stay tuned for more models in the future.
